          <p class="card__text">
            Since the age of sixteen I have been interested in art. My favorite
            mediums to work with are charcoal, acrylic paint, and lineoleum
            printing. Being a creative is one of the things that excites me
            about life the most, that we have the ability as humans to take a
            concept in our minds and bring it to life.

          <p class="card__text">
            Music brings me inspiration and joy, no matter what mood I am in, I
            can always find a song or piece of music to reflect that state.
            Electronic music and dancing in different cities all over the world
            is a continued interest of mine. Living outside of New York City has
            given me an eclectic appreciation for all different types of music.

            Family has always been an important part of my life. My brothers and
            sister have always been a constant support and source of joy. What
            matters most to me is building relationships with the people I love
            most. Creating memories together with my family and friends
            continues to enrich my life.

          <h2 class="card__title">Nature</h2>
          <p class="card__text">
            At the age of thirty six I have traveled to over thirteen different
            countries. The beauty of nature and the diversity continues to
            expand my mind and heart. There are no troubles when I experience
            being outside in the fresh air. Hiking and swimming are my most
            favorite activities in Nature. Long Island continues to be one of my
            favorite places to enjoy nature even with my extensive traveling,
            nothing compares to home.
